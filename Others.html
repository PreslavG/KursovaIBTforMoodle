        <h1>Forest of Knives</h1>
      <p>Located along the west coast, the ‘knives’ are the result of approximately 200 million years of heavy tropical rainfall erosions. It is believed that the ground water from heavy rainfall entered the porous limestones and eventually caves and tunnels were created. But when the roofs of these tunnels and caves collapsed, giant spires emerged showcasing what stands today.

          <h1>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h1>
        <p>If you’ve been planning a trip to Kyoto, you’ve probably seen pictures of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove – along with the torii tunnels of Fushimi-Inari-Taisha Shrine and Kinkaku-ji Temple, it’s one of the most photographed sights in the city. But no picture can capture the feeling of standing in the midst of this sprawling bamboo grove – the whole thing has a palpable sense of otherness that is quite unlike that of any normal forest we know of.</p>

            <h1>Dubrovnik, Croatia</h1>
          <p>At the southernmost point of Croatia, Dubrovnik is cut off from the motherland by a small nook of Bosnia & Hercegovina that bisects the Croatian coast, and it's also the country’s last town before Montenegro. Within these international borders, Dubrovnik was once an independent republic, and today it's the pulsing heart of an exciting region that calls for more than just a mini-break.</p>

              <h1>Cappadocia, Turkey</h1>
            <p>Cappadocia is a beautiful region in central Turkey famous for its fairytale scenery, cave dwellings, remarkable rock formations, and, of course, the hundreds of hot air balloons that soar in the sky during sunrise each morning. There is also so much awesome hiking in Cappadocia, that it will take you at least a week to explore all of the diverse hiking trails in the region.</p>
